# Standup-o-matic

A small Rails + Vanilla.js + TailwindCSS app to help you manage your standups.

## Getting started

Install a recent version of ruby. On OS X you can use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) which will respect the `.ruby-version` in this repository.

Afterwards, run `bundle` to install the various dependencies for the app.

## Running tests

* Unit tests : `bundle exec rails test`
* End to End tests : `bundle exec rails test:system`

## Running the server in development

* `bundle exec rails s`
